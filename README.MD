# Purpose:
Our project, Strands, is a web app that brings together salon owners, employees, customers, and admins in one place to make salon management easier.

Most salons still handle scheduling, appointments, and staff management separately. 
This causes confusion, missed bookings, and extra work for both customers and owners.

We built a single platform that lets:

Customers book and pay for appointments online

Salon owners manage staff, schedules, and revenue from one dashboard

Admins verify salons and view reports on activity and performance and more.
